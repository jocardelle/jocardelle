# Hi! I'm Josephine (Jo) Cardelle 🌿

I'm a current student in UC Santa Barbara's Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program. I am loving learning about all things data science! I also have a degree and work experience in civil engineerings and am interested in the agriculture sector. Outside of work I love hiking, running, soccer, reading, and exploring new places🌍
